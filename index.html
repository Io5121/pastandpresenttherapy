	        <center><p>I help women  who struggle with stress around balancing it all.<p>For some it’s motherhood and career.  For others it’s relationships.  My clients struggle 		like you do.</center></h2></p>  
	        <p>Life can be hard. Finding a therapist is really, really hard.  My clients often tell me that choosing a therapist is one of the hardest things they have 		done. Take the first step.</p>
	        <p>At the first session most of my clients feel nervous, overwhelmed and stretched beyond their breaking point, they tell me about yelling at their kids or 		over indulging in food or too much wine to ease the stress.  Their lives are packed so full that there is no space left to do anything about it.</p>
   	  	<p>You often wonder if anything they do is “good enough”, self doubt and the angry inner critic seems to be in control of their mind.  They feel worried, tired 		and self conscious all the time.  Deep down they are horrified to be found out, that someone will learn they don’t have all their shit together…not *really.
		</p> 
		<p>They have secrets.</p>
		<p>Constant worry gets in the way of living the life they truly want.  They aren’t the mom they want to be.  They are unsure how to be a good friend.  They 		feel depressed that they are failing at being a loving partner, good friend and dependable employee.</p>
		Before they came to see me they felt frazzled, discouraged and hopeless.  They asked themselves, “Why can’t I just do this?”  They worried that this was as 		good as it gets for them.  They were pretty sure they are just being selfish and need to “put my big-girl panties on”.   They feel hollow and are are suffering 		in silence, afraid to tell anyone how much of a fraud they truly are.
		Like my clients, you want to feel better, you deserve to sit and do nothing or to binge a netflix show, read a book, or relax with your feet up without 		constant worry and self doubt niggling at your mind.  Feeling calm and fulfilled without completing that never-ending “to-do” list.</p>
